## Background

I'm a **web developer**, **author**, **speaker**, and **mentor** with a passion
for contributing to awesome software that enriches the lives of others.

I started writing internet software in 2001, primarily using PHP. I've also
occasionally dabbled with other languages such as JavaScript, Java, Python, and
Ruby.

I do not consider opportunities requiring relocation, only those that are local
to the Greater New Orleans area or are remote-friendly.

## Testimonials

> "It has been my distinct pleasure to work with Matthew for several years and
> at several jobs now. While I was at Zend, I worked with him as a PHP
> community member and a speaker at ZendCon, While at ibuildings we regularly
> interacted as members of the PHPC Steering Committee. Finally at Blue
> Parabola we briefly worked together. Each time I worked with Matthew my
> respect for his talents grew deeper. He is a top notch programmer and a
> strong community leader. I always look forward to projects where he and I can
> work together and they come far too sporadically." ~ Cal Evans

> "Adding Matthew to our team was one of the best things we could have done. Not
> only does he know his way around MySQL, PHP and PHPUnit, he was quick to pick
> up the Jersey Java web framework and build on his Javascript knowledge to
> contribute at all levels of our projects. On top of his code based
> contributions, Matthew has given many presentations to fellow developers
> outlining new technologies and how to make the most of older technologies."
> ~ Carlo Costantini

> "Matt continually impressed me throughout the time we worked together as
> co-founders and business partners. Whatever bumps in the road we encountered,
> Matt was a source of stability and dependability. We rarely saw eye to eye,
> but I could count on Matt to be assertive, always striving for excellence.
> Genuine and conscientious, Matt is truly a person of integrity and talent."
> ~ Chelsie Boudreaux

> "Matt's detailed understanding of PHP and its inner-workings are perhaps
> unrivaled in the industry. In addition, his understanding of object oriented
> principles and design patterns result in code that is clean, concise, and
> well-documented. He is a great asset to any team where efficiency and
> attention to detail are vital to producing a flawless product." ~ Aaron Lozier

> "I've worked with Matthew in several different capacities, and I would work
> with him again any day. He is extremely knowledgeable, dependable, and easy
> to work with. He has a wide array of experience in PHP and related subjects,
> and he is always willing to go above and beyond the call of duty to help a
> fellow developer, or newbie. I look forward to working with him again."
> ~ Elizabeth Naramore

> "Matthew Turland has been my student and is my friend. His extraordinary work
> ethic, intelligence, creativity, willingness to help those around him and
> especially to give back to the community of software developers as
> demonstrated over the years that I have known him make it very easy to give
> the very highest possible recommendation." ~ Frank Ducrest

> "In the field of open source, Matt is one of the best programmers on the Gulf
> Coast, and was the first Zend certified engineer in Louisiana. He completely
> rebuilt our massive booksXYZ.com website from scratch in a period of about
> four months, working part time, and handling other programming duties at the
> same time. Matt codes very quickly, and his knowledge of the field is
> extensive. He also constantly combs various sources in the software and open
> source community to stay abreast of the newest programs and engineering
> approaches. Our programmers here at The Acadiana Educational Endowment still
> constantly use him as a resource for advice on programming issues, and he
> regularly updates the staff and me as to news that could affect what we do."
> ~ Joseph Abraham

> "I have been forturnate enough to have worked with Matt twice in our
> respective careers. At Surgisys, I was able to work with him on an almost
> daily basis to collaborate on the functionality and direction of the niche
> medical software product suite the company was creating. Matt's programming
> expertise as well as his ability to quickly understand the specific medical
> environments where the software would be utilized was exceptional. His unique
> set of skills helped him to combine programming best practices with a known
> set of medical practice operating procedures to create an intuitive and
> efficient user interface for Surgisys clients that proved to be an invaluable
> and differentiating feature of our software. I would highly recommend Matt
> and would welcome the opportunity to work with him again in the future."
> ~ Douglas Meaux

> "Matthew has been a valuable asset at METHODS. I managed him on a critical
> project last year. He was placed on the project during the final stages and
> he learned quickly and helped complete the project. Without his
> contributions, the project would not have been completed on time." ~ Ben Williams

> "I worked with Matthew on a project for the Dept. of Environmental Quality.
> Matthew is knowlegdeable and detail oriented. He is sincere about getting his
> work according to the project time line and is a good team player." ~ Arati Kanade

> "Matthew can be relied upon to deliver a high quality product on time with
> little to no supervision necessary. He is pleasant to work with and takes
> direction well." ~ Elizabeth Tucker Long
